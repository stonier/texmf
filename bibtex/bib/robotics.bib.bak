  abstract = {Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) are known to be non-
	
	holonomic systems, and most dynamic models of WMRs assume that
	
	the wheels undergo rolling without slipping. This paper deals with
	the
	
	problem of modeling and simulation of motion of a WMR when the
	
	conditions for rolling are not satisfied at the wheels. We use a traction
	
	model where the adhesion coefficient between the wheels of a WMR and
	
	a hard flat surface is a function of the wheel slip. This traction
	model is
	
	used in conjunction with the dynamic equations of motion to simulate
	the
	
	motion of the WMR. The simulations show that controllers which do
	not
	
	take into account wheel slip give poor tracking performance for the
	WMR
	
	and path deviation is small only for large adhesion coefficients.
	This work
	
	shows the importance of wheel slip and suggests use of accurate traction
	
	models for improving tracking performance of a WMR.},

	base places special demands on the vehicle’s drive system. For smooth,
	accurate motion and coordination with an on-board manipulator, a
	holonomic vibration-free wheel system that can be dynamically controlled
	is needed. In this paper, we present the design and development of
	a powered caster vehicle (PCV), which is shown to possess the desired
	mechanical properties. To dynamically control the PCV, a new approach
	for modeling and controlling the dynamics of this parallel redundant
	system is proposed. The experimental results presented in the paper
	illustrate the performance of this platform and demonstrate the signiﬁcance
	of dynamic control and its effectiveness in mobile manipulation tasks.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to understand the nonlinear dynamics
	of longitudinal ground vehicle traction. Speciﬁcally, single-wheel
	models of rubber-tired automobiles under straight-ahead braking and
	acceleration conditions are investigated in detail. Customarily,
	the forward vehicle speed and the rotational rate of the tire/wheel
	are taken as dynamic states. This paper motivates an alternative
	formulation in which wheel slip, a dimen-sionless measure of the
	difference between the vehicle speed and the circumferential speed
	of the tire relative to the wheel center, replaces the angular velocity
	of the tire/wheel as a dynamic state. This formulation offers new
	insight into the dynamic behavior of vehicle traction. The unique
	features of the modeling approach allow one to capture the full range
	of dynamic responses of the single-wheel traction models in a relatively
	simple geometric manner. The models developed here may also be useful
	for developing and implementing anti-lock brake and traction control
	control schemes.},

	More than three wheels provide redundancy: many combinations of motors
