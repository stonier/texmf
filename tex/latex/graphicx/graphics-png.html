<h2>Including graphics in LaTeX/PDF documents</h2>

Here we discuss how to include graphics in a LaTeX document intended
to be later converted to PDF format, paying special attention to how
to maintain simultaneous DVI and PDF versions of the same document.

<p>

If the document has no graphics, the DVI version can be produced with
<b>latex</b>, and the PDF version with <b>pdflatex</b>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
latex filename.tex

pdflatex filename.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>
If the document does have graphics, then a solution is to produce a
PostScript version with <b>dvips</b> (taking care of using the
<tt>-Ppdf</tt> flag) and to distill it later with the Acrobat
Distiller.  In our system both operations can be done in one step by
using the <b>dvi2pdf</b> command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
dvi2pdf filename.dvi
</pre>
</blockquote>
However this has several drawbacks.  The Acrobat Distiller is a
commercial program, so it costs money to purchase and upgrade (we have
been using a "frozen" version purchased several years ago).  Also in
some situations it may give problems with fonts.  So it is a good idea
to have an alternative based on free software only.  A possibility is
to use the <b>dvipdfm</b> command (included in the RedHat distribution
of Linux):
<blockquote>
<pre>
dvipdfm filename.dvi
</pre>
</blockquote>

Another alternative (which we
discuss below) is to to include graphics in a way that both
<b>latex</b> and <b>pdflatex</b> can manage.

<p>

Graphics can be produced in various formats.  For inclusion in a DVI
file by <b>latex</b> they must be in EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
format.  Unfortunately EPS files cannot be included in PDF documents
with <b>pdflatex</b>, they must be either in PDF format or in one of
various graphic formats such as PNG or JPEG.  The way graphics are
usually included are also different: <b>latex</b> uses the
<tt>\psfig</tt> command (and the psfig or epsfig package), and
<b>pdflatex</b> uses <tt>\pdfimage</tt>.  There is however a command
that can be processed by both <b>latex</b> and <b>pdflatex</b>:
<tt>\includegraphics</tt> from the <tt>graphics</tt> package - with
added options if the <tt>graphicx</tt> package is used.

<p>

So assume that you have a figure in an EPS file <tt>foo.ps</tt> and 
want to include it in a LaTeX file <tt>filename.tex</tt> to be 
processed by both latex and pdflatex.  Do the following:

<ol>

<p><li> Make a PDF version of the figure:
<blockquote>
<pre>
epstopdf foo.ps
</pre>
</blockquote>
That produces <tt>foo.pdf</tt>. You may also convert your EPS file to
PNG or some other graphic format if you wish:
<blockquote>
<pre>
convert foo.ps foo.png 
</pre>
</blockquote>
Keep both files, the original <tt>foo.ps</tt> and the new
<tt>foo.pdf</tt> (or <tt>foo.png</tt>, etc.) together in the working
directory, since both will be needed.

<p><li> Include the <tt>graphicx</tt> package in your LaTeX file with
<tt>\usepackage{graphicx}</tt>.

<p><li> Use the <tt>\includegraphics</tt> command with the name of the
graphic file <tt>foo</tt> <em>without extension</em>.  By doing so
each of <b>latex</b> and <b>pdflatex</b> will choose the correct
version of the file to be included, i.e., <b>latex</b> will use
<tt>foo.ps</tt> and <b>pdflatex</b> will use <tt>foo.pdf</tt> (or
<tt>foo.png</tt>, or whatever graphic format you have chosen).

</ol>

<p>

The following example illustrates the use of the <tt>graphicx</tt>
package and the <tt>\includegraphics</tt> command:
<blockquote>
<font color=brown>
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
   
\begin{document}
   
Some text...

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1in,width=1in,angle=-90]{foo}
\caption{This is a figure.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

More text...

\end{document}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

The syntax of the <tt>\includegraphics</tt> command is as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\includegraphics[<em>parameters</em>]{<i>filename</i>}
</pre>
</blockquote>
where <em>parameters</em> is a comma-separated list of any of the
following: <tt>bb=</tt><i>llx lly urx ury</i> (bounding box),
<tt>width=</tt><i>h_length</i>, <tt>height=</tt><i>v_length</i>,
<tt>angle=</tt><i>angle</i>, <tt>scale=</tt><i>factor</i>,
<tt>clip=</tt><i>true/false</i>, <tt>draft=</tt><i>true/false</i>.
